## Description

This assignment allowed me to create my first site. The website will be something I will continue to touch up on and feel comfortable to show to future companies to show case some of the projects I've completed. I haven't done any amazing project yet, so I will just showcase the first week assignment and plans on replacing it in the future. In this site, I wrote a little description about myself, and created different types of links to contact me. Creating this website was a challange and helps me improves and touch up my CSS and HTML knowledges I learned in bootcamp.
